# Code Review Checklist

Quick-scan checklist organized by review dimension. Use during reviews for systematic coverage.

## Project Guidelines Compliance
- [ ] Follows import patterns from CLAUDE.md / project config
- [ ] Naming conventions match codebase (camelCase, snake_case, etc.)
- [ ] Error handling follows project patterns
- [ ] File size within project limits
- [ ] Framework conventions respected

## Bug Detection
- [ ] No logic errors (wrong comparisons, inverted conditions)
- [ ] Null/undefined handled on nullable values
- [ ] No race conditions on shared mutable state
- [ ] Resources properly closed/cleaned up
- [ ] No off-by-one or boundary errors
- [ ] State transitions are consistent

## Security
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials, API keys, or tokens
- [ ] No SQL injection (parameterized queries used)
- [ ] No XSS (user input escaped/sanitized)
- [ ] No path traversal (file paths validated)
- [ ] CSRF protection on state-changing endpoints
- [ ] Auth checks on all protected routes
- [ ] No secrets logged or exposed in error messages
- [ ] Dependencies free of known vulnerabilities

## Silent Failure Detection
- [ ] No empty catch blocks
- [ ] Errors logged, reported, or re-thrown
- [ ] No broad `catch (e: any)` swallowing specific errors
- [ ] User informed of operation failures
- [ ] No mock/stub implementations in production code
- [ ] Promise rejections handled
- [ ] Default fallbacks don't hide real errors

## Test Coverage
- [ ] Critical paths tested end-to-end
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty, null, boundary values)
- [ ] Error handling paths tested
- [ ] Integration points tested
- [ ] No high-risk regression paths left uncovered

## Type Design Quality
- [ ] Implementation details behind interfaces
- [ ] Types make invalid states unrepresentable
- [ ] No `any` abuse or stringly-typed APIs
- [ ] No exposed mutable internals
- [ ] No god objects (10+ fields)

## Code Simplification
- [ ] No deep nesting (>3 levels)
- [ ] No duplicate/redundant logic
- [ ] Clear, descriptive naming
- [ ] No unnecessary abstractions or over-engineering
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"
- [ ] No unresolved TODOs without issue references
