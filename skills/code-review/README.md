## Usage Modes

| Mode | Trigger | Diff Source |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **PR Review** | `/review #123` | `gh pr diff 123` |
| **Local Branch** | `/review --local` | `git diff main...HEAD` |
| **Auto-detect** | `/review` | Staged > unstaged > branch diff |
| **Thorough** | `/review --thorough` | Same as above, 3 parallel passes |

## Conventional Comments Labels

| Label | Intent | Blocking |
|-------|--------|----------|
| issue | A problem that must or should be addressed | Yes (with `(blocking)` decoration) |
| suggestion | Improvement or better approach | No |
| todo | Required follow-up task | No |
| question | Seeking clarification | No |
| thought | Observation for consideration | No |
| note | Informational highlight | No |
| chore | Maintenance or cleanup | No |
| praise | Positive feedback | No |

See `references/review-conventional-comments.md` for full definitions, decorations, and scoring rules.

## Review Dimensions

1. **Project Guidelines Compliance** — Conventions from CLAUDE.md
2. **Bug Detection** — Logic errors, null handling, race conditions
3. **Security** — Injection, XSS, auth, secrets, CSRF
4. **Silent Failure Detection** — Empty catches, swallowed errors
5. **Test Coverage Analysis** — Behavioral coverage gaps
6. **Type Design Quality** — Invariants, encapsulation, anti-patterns
7. **Code Simplification** — Nesting, naming, redundancy

## Verdicts

- **APPROVE** — No `issue` or `todo` findings
- **COMMENT** — Has `issue` or `todo` findings but none `(blocking)`
- **REQUEST CHANGES** — Any `(blocking)` finding present
